# Test data for SPARQL 1.0

This repo contains the test data used   for  the first ClioPatria SPARQL
endpoint implementation as well as the SeRQL  endpoint. We have out this
in a seperate repository to keep the implementation clean.

The ARQ test-set comes from the Jena   project.  It was downloaded using
CVS from

    :pserver:anonymous@jena.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jena

The test-suite-archive comes from the SPARQL   site,  downloaded on June
17, 2009.
